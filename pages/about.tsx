  <h1 >About Us</h1>
  <p>
    The Good Karma Music & Arts Festival is excited to announce its official launch, set to take place on November 4 at the Santa Clarita Skate Park and Field. The festival, previously known as the Summer Meltdown Autism Awareness Music Festival, has been re-branded with the goal of training and educating people with disabilities to work in the entertainment industry.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Good Karma Music & Arts Festival was created by Yes I Can Unity Through Music & Education, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization located in Santa Clarita, CA.
    The festival will feature a range of artists on two stages, as well as live art demonstrations, a beer garden, food, and local vendors. Unlike most other music festivals, the Good Karma Music & Arts Festival is organized by a group of students who believe that everyone deserves a chance to showcase their abilities. The festival provides a platform for them to do just that. By working at the management and production level of the entire operation, students are able to work alongside industry professionals, and in many cases, are mentored directly by the industry`&apos;`s most elite concert promoters, bands, artists, media publicists, managers, booking agents, production companies, photographers, and more.
    <br />
    <br />
    The goal of GKMAF is twofold: to provide residents of Southern California with a fun, unique festival experience, as well as to celebrate diversity in the workplace, which enables students to showcase their strengths and talents to potential employers.
